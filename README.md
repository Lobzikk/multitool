# Lobzikk's Multitool
This multitool features a lot of things: writing and editing your notes, Walmart price monitoring with customizable graphs (you can even use your own data!), satisfying physical simulations (Newton's cradle, bouncing ball, realistic water and etc.), chat with other users! Discord integration is also available. This project mostly runs on Electron.js + React.js, so it shouldn't be too laggy.
